          <h1>Introduction</h1>
        </header>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica_oleracea" target="_blank">Brassica oleracea</a> is a plant species that includes many common cultivars, such as cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, collard greens, Savoy cabbage, kohlrabi, and gai lan. In its uncultivated form, it is called wild cabbage and is native to coastal southern and western Europe.</p>
        <p>The cultivars of B. oleracea are grouped by developmental form into seven major cultivar groups, of which the Acephala ("non-heading") group remains most like the natural wild cabbage in appearance:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Brassica oleracea Acephala group – kale</li>
          <li>Brassica oleracea Viridis group – collard greens</li>
          <li>Brassica oleracea Alboglabra group – kai-lan (Chinese broccoli)</li>
          <li>Brassica oleracea Botrytis group – cauliflower, Romanesco broccoli, and broccoflower</li>
          <li>Brassica oleracea Capitata group – cabbage</li>
          <li>Brassica oleracea Gemmifera group – Brussels sprouts</li>
          <li>Brassica oleracea Gongylodes group – kohlrabi</li>
          <li>Brassica oleracea Italica group – broccoli</li>

          <h2>Cabbage</h2>
        </header>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbage">Cabbage</a>, comprising several cultivars of Brassica oleracea, is a leafy green, red (purple), or white (pale green) biennial plant grown as an annual vegetable crop for its dense-leaved heads. It is descended from the wild cabbage (B. oleracea var. oleracea), and belongs to the "cole crops" or brassicas, meaning it is closely related to broccoli and cauliflower (var. botrytis); Brussels sprouts (var. gemmifera); and Savoy cabbage (var. sabauda).</p>
        <p>There are several cultivar groups of cabbage, each including many cultivars:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoy_cabbage">Savoy</a> – Characterized by crimped or curly leaves, mild flavor and tender texture</li>
          <li>Spring greens (Brassica oleracea) – Loose-headed, commonly sliced and steamed[28]</li>
          <li>Green – Light to dark green, slightly pointed heads.[28]</li>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_cabbage">Red</a> – Smooth red leaves, often used for pickling or stewing[28]</li>
          <li>White, also called Dutch – Smooth, pale green leaves[28]</li>

          <h2>Broccoli</h2>
        </header>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broccoli">Broccoli</a> (Brassica oleracea var. italica) is an edible green plant in the cabbage family (family Brassicaceae, genus Brassica) whose large flowering head, stalk and small associated leaves are eaten as a vegetable. Broccoli is classified in the Italica cultivar group of the species Brassica oleracea. Broccoli has large flower heads, usually dark green, arranged in a tree-like structure branching out from a thick stalk which is usually light green. The mass of flower heads is surrounded by leaves. Broccoli resembles cauliflower, which is a different but closely related cultivar group of the same Brassica species.</p>

          <h2>Cauliflower</h2>
        </header>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauliflower">Cauliflower</a> is one of several vegetables in the species Brassica oleracea in the genus Brassica, which is in the Brassicaceae (or mustard) family. It is an annual plant that reproduces by seed. Typically, only the head is eaten – the edible white flesh sometimes called "curd" (with a similar appearance to cheese curd).[1] The cauliflower head is composed of a white inflorescence meristem. Cauliflower heads resemble those in broccoli, which differs in having flower buds as the edible portion. Brassica oleracea also includes broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, collard greens, and kale, collectively called "cole" crops,[2] though they are of different cultivar groups.</p>

        <header>
          <h2>Kale</h2>
        </header>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kale">Kale</a> (/keɪl/), or leaf cabbage, belongs to a group of cabbage (Brassica oleracea) cultivars grown for their edible leaves, although some are used as ornamentals. Kale plants have green or purple leaves, and the central leaves do not form a head (as with headed cabbage). Kales are considered to be closer to wild cabbage than most of the many domesticated forms of Brassica oleracea.[1]</p>

          <h2>Collard</h2>
        </header>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collard_(plant)">Collard</a> is a group of certain loose-leafed cultivars of Brassica oleracea, the same species as many common vegetables including cabbage (Capitata group) and broccoli (Italica group). Collard is a member of the Viridis group of Brassica oleracea.[1][2] American collard cultivars are more correctly placed in the Viridis cultivar group due to a high genetic similarity with cabbage, although older publications often include them within the Acephala group (kale).[3] The name "collard" comes from the word "colewort" (a medieval term for non-heading brassica crops).[4][5]</p>

          <h2>Brussels Sprout</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_sprout">Brussels sprout</a> is a member of the Gemmifera cultivar group of cabbages (Brassica oleracea), grown for its edible buds. The leaf vegetables are typically 1.5–4.0 cm (0.6–1.6 in) in diameter and resemble miniature cabbages. The Brussels sprout has long been popular in Brussels, Belgium, from which it gained its name.</p>
        <p>Although native to the Mediterranean region with other cabbage species, Brussels sprouts first appeared in northern Europe during the 5th century, later being cultivated in the 13th century near Brussels, Belgium, from which they derived their name.[1][2] Its group name Gemmifera (or lowercase and italicized gemmifera as a variety name) means gemmiferous (bud-producing).</p>
